	abstract = {Compressor surge is shown by the application of several types of instrumentation (notably a hot-wire anemometer) to consist of two distinct types of phenomena. The whole compressor flow system may be unstable in the manner of a self-excited Helmholtz resonator. The theory of this instability is presented and is shown to explain some of the observed pulsation symptoms. The stalling of the flow through the blade rows, which usually is assumed to be the origin of pulsation, is shown to occur in propagating groups of 1 to 5 regions involving from 2 to 20 blades each. The theory of this “stall propagation” shows the propagation velocity relative to the wheel to be dependent upon boundary-layer growth parameters and hence the frequency (relative to a stationary probe) to be proportional to the wheel speed. Another part of observed compressor pulsation thus is explained. These two phenomena frequently interact to produce complex performance characteristics. The theories presented are essentially correct as shown by experimental verification, but much remains to be done to make quantitative compressor-performance prediction practical.},

In particular, it is shown that the unsteady growth or decay of the stall cell can have a significant effect on the instantaneous compressor pumping characteristic and hence on the overall system behavior. A limited parametric study is carried out to illustrate the impact of different system features on transient behavior. It is shown, for example, that the ultimate mode of system response, surge or stable rotating stall, depends not only on the B parameter, but also on the compressor length-to-radius ratio. Small values of the latter quantity tend to favor the occurrence of surge, as do large values of B. Based on the analytical and numerical results, some specific topics are suggested for future research on post-stall transients.},

The sudden changes in velocity across blade rows as the blade passages enter and leave the stall are shown to have important dynamical consequences for the stall flow field. The one empirical constant needed in the analysis is determined using the data of Day [1]. From this, reasonable predictions of stall cell speed and trends in speed have been obtained for a number of different compressors. From the satisfactory comparison between predicted and measured stall cell speeds, it is tentatively concluded that the model contains the essentials of a correct description of the controlling mechanism of full-span rotating stall.},

	abstract = {A review is presented of the types of instabilities which are encountered in pumping systems of technological interest. These include axial and centrifugal compression systems, pumping systems involving cavitation, systems with two-phase flow, systems with combustion, hydraulic systems, and systems which have two or more pumping elements in parallel. All of the above will be seen to exhibit instabilities under certain operating conditions, although the mechanism of instability, as well as the particular system element that is responsible for the instability, will be quite different in the different systems. However, several basic concepts, such as the idea of negative damping which is associated with dynamic instability, will be seen to be common to the different systems. The review is organized around the different types of systems that are discussed, and includes descriptions of the steady-state performance, the regimes in which one would expect instability, and the mechanisms of instability. An idealized pumping system is first examined to illustrate some of the basic concepts. More realistic systems are then treated in the same manner of showing steady-state performance, regimes of instability and mechanisms. In the review attention is given mainly to those areas in which there is high current engineering interest, and an attempt is made to describe those areas of research which can be most fruitfully pursued. In general, it is suggested that efforts should be directed toward obtaining an improved understanding of the transient behavior of the active (instability causing) elements within the system, since it is lack of knowledge of this aspect that currently limits the accuracy of system stability predictions.},

The correlation is derived from new measurements of stalled compressor performance which have been obtained using a series of different compressor builds. In these experiments the compressor design parameters were systematically varied so that the influence of each could be clearly seen. It is shown that the stall cell blockage is an important parameter for correlating the flow regimes in stall, and hence the overall compressor performance. The resulting correlation, which has been developed based on a heuristic model of the stalled flow, can be applied to predict whether a given compressor will exhibit full-span or part-span stall, as well as the extent of the stall-unstall hysteresis loop. In particular, it is shown that as the number of stages and/or the design value of axial velocity parameter increases, the trend is toward both full-span stall and large hysteresis loops.},

With the experimental facility the physical parameters of the compression system could be independently varied so that their influence on the transient system behavior can be clearly seen. In addition, a new data analysis procedure has been developed, using a plenum mass balance, which enables the instantaneous compressor mass flow to be accurately calculated. This information is coupled to the unsteady pressure measurements to provide the first detailed quantitative picture of instantaneous compressor operation during both surge and rotating stall transients. The experimental results are compared to a theoretical model of the transient system response. The theoretical criterion for predicting which mode of compression system instability, rotating stall or surge, will occur is in good accord with the data. The basic scaling concepts that have been developed for relating transient data at different corrected speeds and geometrical parameters are also verified. Finally, the model is shown to provide an adequate quantitative description of the motion of the compression system operating point during the transients that occur subsequent to the onset of axial compressor stall.},

A nonlinear model is developed to predict the transient response of a compression system subsequent to a perturbation from steady operating conditions. It is found that for the system investigated there is an important nondimensional parameter on which this response depends. Whether this parameter is above or below a critical value determines which mode of compressor instability, rotating stall or surge, will be encountered at the stall line. For values above the critical, the system will exhibit the large amplitude oscillatory behavior characteristic of surge; while for values below the critical it will move toward operation in rotating stall, at a substantially reduced flow rate and pressure ratio. Numerical results are presented to show the motion of the compression system operating point during these two basic modes of instability, and a physical explanation is given for the mechanism associated with the generation of surge cycle oscillations.},

An exact solution is found which requires the operating point to be at the minimum or maximum of the parabola. If the characteristic is flat in a deep-stall regime, the previous harmonic solution applies with neither reverse flow or “unstalling.” If the characteristic is concave upward in deep stall, the disturbance has a skewed shape, steeper at the stall-zone trailing edge as experiment shows. Propagation speed is only slightly affected by this nonlinearity. Near stall inception, negative curvature in combination with multiple stall zones can limit the nonlinear oscillation, in the manner of “progressive” stall. If, as seems likely, lag at stall inception is negative (opposite to inertia), propagation speed exceeds 1/2 wheel speed, as experiments suggest.},

In the compressor, a pressure-rise hysteresis is assumed. Flow in entrance and exit ducts yield additional lags. These lags balance to give a formula for stall propagation speed. For small disturbances, it is required that the compressor characteristics be flat in the neighborhood of average flow coefficient. Results are compared with the experiments of Day and Cumpsty. If a compressor lag of about twice that due only to fluid inertia is used, predicted propagation speeds agree almost exactly with experimental values, taking into account changes of number of stages, stagger angle, row spacing, and number of stall zones. The agreement obtained gives encouragement for the extension of the theory to account for large amplitudes.},
